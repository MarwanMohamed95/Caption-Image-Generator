# **Image Caption Generator** 

In this project I implemented image caption generator that takes an input image and generate a caption that describes the image.
- First we will extract the features from the images using Xception pre-trained model and encode the captions using Keras tokenizer class to train the model.
- in testing we will feed the model with the feature of the test image and a starting word to generate the second word and this process will repeat recursively to generate the full description caption.     
    # Steps of the project:
    --------------------------------
    1. Importing Required Libraries
    2. Retrieving the data (Images and Desctiption Captions)
    3. Defining the Pathes variables
    4. Preparing the images
    * 4.1. Defining the model
    * 4.2. Extracting the features from the images

    5. Preparing the Description Captions text
    * 5.1. Loading the captions of all images
    * 5.2. Creating the dictionary of images-captions pairs
    * 5.3. Cleaning the descriptions

    6. Preparing the training data (features and description captions)
    7. Tokenization
    * 7.1. Creating the training corpus
    * 7.2. Creaing the tokenizer object to map each word to number

    8. Preparing the validation data: (features and description)
    9. Creating the data generator
    10. Defining the model
    11. Testing the model on the testing images

## An overview of the Xception model
- Xception is a deep convolutional neural network architecture that involves Depthwise Separable Convolutions. Xception is also known as ‚Äúextreme‚Äù version of an Inception module.
